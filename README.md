## Installation

You can add Yuu to your current VuePress project by running:

```bash
yarn add vuepress-theme-yuu
# or npm install vuepress-theme-yuu
```

And then setting it in your `docs/.vuepress/config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
	theme: 'yuu',
};
```

Yuu is extended upon the default VuePress theme (with some adjustments), so you get all the great features it already provides!
